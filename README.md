# Implementation-of-SVM-For-Spam-Mail-Detection

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
 1.Import the necessary python packages using import statements.
 
 2.Read the given csv file using read_csv() method and print the number of contents to
 be displayed using df.head().
 
 3.Split the dataset using train_test_split.
 
 4.Calculate Y_Pred and accuracy.
 
 5.Print all the outputs.
 
 6.End the Program
